# Problem and idea for solution
Books are the traditional way of storing and transcieving information and culture. their sole porpuse is to be read.
Hence a book on the shelf is a wasted book which is to be avoided. To do so, this repository gives a text for each language submitted to bind the reader to give the book in hands to someone who has the believable intent to read the book, once finished or stalled. Thereby, given the respective behaviour, the effectivness of the book is optimized. To widen the range where you can use the test simple language is to be preferred.

# Scope
This text mainly focuses on books in their "hardware-form", meaning the book you can hold in hands as the price to multiplicate a digital copy of a book, aka ebooks, is near-zero and hence there is no reason not to free these by technological means.
An extension to tools might be possible but requires consideration of the differences between tools and books, like the requirement of a usecase to use a tool in a meaningful way, while reading a book always is meaningful.
